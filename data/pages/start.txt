====== Home Lab Documentation ======

===== Hardware Setup =====
  * **Dell OptiPlex 5050** repurposed as a primary lab machine.
  * **Raspberry Pi** used for DNS sinkhole and web services.
  * **USB Flash Drives**:
    * 256 GB USB used initially for Windows 11 bootable media.  
      → Lesson learned: only ~16 GB is required.
    * Another USB prepared as a bootable **Proxmox installer**.

===== Operating Systems & Hypervisors =====
  * **Windows 11**: Installed on Dell OptiPlex 5050 as a baseline OS.
  * **Proxmox VE**: Installed on the Dell OptiPlex via USB for virtualization.

===== Virtual Machines & Services =====
  * **Pi-hole (Raspberry Pi)**:
    * Configured as a DNS sinkhole for ad/tracker blocking.
    * Integrated into the home network.
  * **Ubuntu Server (Proxmox VM)**:
    * Created as a base server OS for experiments.
  * **TrueNAS (Proxmox VM)**:
    * Deployed for network-attached storage (NAS).
  * **OPNsense (Proxmox VM)**:
    * Installed as a firewall/router for segmentation and security.

===== Web Services & Documentation =====
  * **Apache2 on Raspberry Pi**: Installed and configured.
  * **DokuWiki**:
    * Installed under `/var/www/html/dokuwiki`.
    * VirtualHost configured in Apache for port `8080`.
    * Being used as the central documentation hub.

===== Networking & Security Projects =====
  * **DNS Sinkhole**: Implemented using Pi-hole.
  * **Packet Capture**: Began experimenting with traffic analysis.

===== Lessons Learned =====
  - USB boot media only needs ~16 GB for Windows install.
  - Proxmox allows running multiple networking/security VMs.
  - Pi-hole provides security benefits and traffic visibility.
  - DokuWiki is now the central place to log lab progress.

===== Today’s Achievements =====
  * Deployed Pi-hole, packet capture, and DokuWiki.
  * Debugged and configured Apache VirtualHost.
  * Established a sustainable documentation workflow.

====== Lab Network Setup ======

=== Cisco 2600 Router Configuration / 24AUG25 ===
  * **FastEthernet0/0 (WAN)**  
    - IP: 192.168.1.36 (DHCP from ISP)  
    - Connected to ISP router (192.168.1.1)  
  * **FastEthernet0/1 (LAN)**  
    - IP: 192.168.10.1/24 (LAN Gateway)  
    - Connected to Catalyst 2950 Switch (Port 1)  
  * **Routing**  
    - Default route → 192.168.1.1 (ISP)  
  * **Verification**  
    - Pings to 192.168.1.1 successful  
    - Pings to 8.8.8.8 & www.google.com successful after NAT configuration  

=== Cisco Catalyst 2950 Switch ===
  * **Management Interface (VLAN1)**  
    - IP: 192.168.1.50/24  
    - Default gateway: 192.168.1.1  
  * **Ports**  
    - FastEthernet0/1 → Connected to Router 2600 (LAN side)  
    - Other ports available for lab devices  
  * **Verification**  
    - Pings to router successful  
    - Switch reachable via management IP  

=== Proxmox Host ===
  * **IP Address**: 192.168.1.100  
  * Running multiple VMs:  
    - Ubuntu Server (lab services)  
    - Docker Host  
    - Future: Security/Networking VMs  

=== Raspberry Pi 4 ===
  * **IP Address**: 192.168.1.96  
  * Role: DNS Sinkhole (Pi-hole)  
  * Provides DNS filtering for the lab  

=== MacBook Pro (Mgmt Workstation) ===
  * **IP Address**: 192.168.1.117  
  * Used for:  
    - Console access (via PuTTY)  
    - Proxmox management  
    - Lab documentation in DokuWiki  

=== Current Topology ===
  * ISP Router (192.168.1.1) ↔ Cisco 2600 (WAN: 192.168.1.36)  
  * Cisco 2600 (LAN: 192.168.10.1) ↔ Cisco Catalyst 2950 (Mgmt IP: 192.168.1.50)  
  * Lab devices (Proxmox, Raspberry Pi, MacBook) on 192.168.1.x network
