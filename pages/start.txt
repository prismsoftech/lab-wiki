====== Home Lab Documentation ======

===== Hardware Setup =====
  * **Dell OptiPlex 5050** repurposed as a primary lab machine.
  * **Raspberry Pi** used for DNS sinkhole and web services.
  * **USB Flash Drives**:
    * 256 GB USB used initially for Windows 11 bootable media.  
      → Lesson learned: only ~16 GB is required.
    * Another USB prepared as a bootable **Proxmox installer**.

===== Operating Systems & Hypervisors =====
  * **Windows 11**: Installed on Dell OptiPlex 5050 as a baseline OS.
  * **Proxmox VE**: Installed on the Dell OptiPlex via USB for virtualization.

===== Virtual Machines & Services =====
  * **Pi-hole (Raspberry Pi)**:
    * Configured as a DNS sinkhole for ad/tracker blocking.
    * Integrated into the home network.
  * **Ubuntu Server (Proxmox VM)**:
    * Created as a base server OS for experiments.
  * **TrueNAS (Proxmox VM)**:
    * Deployed for network-attached storage (NAS).
  * **OPNsense (Proxmox VM)**:
    * Installed as a firewall/router for segmentation and security.

===== Web Services & Documentation =====
  * **Apache2 on Raspberry Pi**: Installed and configured.
  * **DokuWiki**:
    * Installed under `/var/www/html/dokuwiki`.
    * VirtualHost configured in Apache for port `8080`.
    * Being used as the central documentation hub.

===== Networking & Security Projects =====
  * **DNS Sinkhole**: Implemented using Pi-hole.
  * **Packet Capture**: Began experimenting with traffic analysis.

===== Lessons Learned =====
  - USB boot media only needs ~16 GB for Windows install.
  - Proxmox allows running multiple networking/security VMs.
  - Pi-hole provides security benefits and traffic visibility.
  - DokuWiki is now the central place to log lab progress.

===== ✅ Today’s Achievements =====
  * Deployed Pi-hole, packet capture, and DokuWiki.
  * Debugged and configured Apache VirtualHost.
  * Established a sustainable documentation workflow.
